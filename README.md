# 10.000ft Scripts - Workflow for Alfred #
10.000ft workflow for Alfred, the aim is to make working with 10.000ft faster.

This script is a very simple first version and a research project and not really meant for distribution (yet) but just try it! And please, [give me feedback!](https://github.com/jceelen/alfred-10000ft-scripts/issues) :-). I am happy to help with questions.

## Features ##

- gets realtime data (and saves it in cache) from 10.000ft using the API
- opens the edit page of a project directly from Alfred
