Alfred Workflow for 10.000ft
============================
A very simple first version of a workflow for 10.000ft with 1 feature: opening the edit page of a project directly from Alfred. The script is a research project and not really meant for distribution.

##Requirements
- Get your API Key from [10.000ft](http://10000ft.us6.list-manage2.com/subscribe?u=9c2ec42cba0e4196798807690&id=be8afd4d34)
- [Alfred App](https://www.alfredapp.com) (tested on v3)

##Usage
- First run: Copy your API key to the clipboard, and use `.10ksetkey` to save your API key in the OSX Keychain
- `10k` will show a list of projects
